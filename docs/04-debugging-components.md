To debug your tests and component code in the browser:

1. Run `npm run test:watch`. This command should automatically open up the Chrome browser.
2. In Chrome click the 'Debug' button and open the Developer tools (Command + Shift + C).
3. Now you can add breakpoints in the test code or the component code to debug issues.
