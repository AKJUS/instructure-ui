## Accessibility

We aim to make our software accessible to everyone, including those with visions, hearing, cognative, or motor impairments.  
Having an Accessible Design allows people of all abilities to interact with, understand and navigate our products.  This means
that components are [Perceiveable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).  This includes being High Contrast aware so that colors meet [4.5:1](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html) (for standard or small text) and [3:1](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G183.html) (for larger text) contrast ratios, is keyboard friendly (proper use of tabIndex, logical tab order, ESC to close modals, etc), and can be navigated while utilizing ScreenReader technology (all inputs labeled, use native controls, utilize screenreader-only text).
