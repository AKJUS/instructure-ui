## Themes

The react components use the [@instructure/ui-themeable](#themeable) library along
with a [babel plugin](#babel-plugin-themeable-styles) to import CSS styles and generate theme
variables.

For details on how to theme components, see the [@instructure/ui-themeable](#themeable) documentation.
