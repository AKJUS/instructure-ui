## 0.14.0

### Breaking changes (code changes required to upgrade)

#### Inject Component CSS into the document

Components will now inject the required CSS into the document when they are mounted, so importing the CSS dependencies is no longer required. The usage documentation for each component has been updated to reflect this change.

#### Added babel-polyfill as a peer dependency

The components now require babel-polyfill.

#### Updates to form input components

All of the form input components now consistently handle focus and validation messages. As a result the `errors` prop is now the `messages` prop for all form inputs.

### New components and bug fixes

#### Add Progress component

See [documentation and examples](#Progress) for details.

#### Fix Spinner component animation in Firefox

See [commit](https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/commit/f7a0fec6bb95b1baa42e83593a01b50bdab77438) for details.

#### Remove references to the DOM at require time

This should allow for running tests using instructure-ui components without a browser.

#### Updates to colors and typography

The global colors have been updated and the required font family is now Lato. A [Typography](#Typography) component has been added.

#### Fix imports of instructure-icons components

Icons are now imported individually to reduce the overall library bundle size.

#### Prevent React warnings by removing invalid props passed down to children

#### Add levels to Heading component

The [Heading](#Heading) component now supports levels 1-5 (and a reset) and also supports overriding the root
element.
