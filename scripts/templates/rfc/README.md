## ${COMPONENT} Component
<!--
What does Product Design call this component?
What name would work best for describing this component's functionality and for communication between Product and Engineering?
-->


### Summary
<!--
This should be what is used for the description documentation.
What is this component?
What does it do?
How is it used?
-->
TBD



### Use Cases
<!--
Ideally this section should include designs and examples provided by Product Design. If no comps are provided, describe
the use case in as much detail as possible.
-->
TBD


### Other Implementations
<!--
List links to implementations of this type of component in other component libraries. This will give us an idea of what we'll need for our component API and/or some possible 3rd party libraries we can make use of to speed up development.
-->
TBD


### Functional Requirements and API
<!--
Are there props/functions that should be consistent with other components?
Are there any existing components that we can leverage to compose this component?
-->
TBD


### Examples
```javascript

```

### Properties
| Prop     | Type     | Default  | Notes    |
|----------|-------------|----------|----------|


### Dependencies
<!--
What other components or utilities will this component depend on?
This will help us decide what package the component should be in.
-->
TBD


### Theme Variables
<!--
What parts of the component will need to use theme variables?
-->
TBD


### Accessibility Requirements
<!--
Are there specific accessibility (a11y) needs for this component?
How should a keyboard-only user be able to use this component?
Remember: if using colors other than grayscale, we need to make sure to test for a11y contrast
Are all the focus states addressed?
-->
TBD


### Internationalization Requirements
<!--
Can we make props for any strings that are needed?
Do we need to format dates or times?
What do we need to do to support RTL languages?
Will long strings break the layout?
-->
TBD


### Other Things to Consider
<!--
What other "gotchas" should we be aware of with this component?
Are there deprecations or breaking changes require for this component?
Are there design aspects that need to be re-addressed/aligned with Product?
-->
TBD
